# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Jupyter Notebook, demonstrating core programming concepts. This project showcases the power of functions, conditions, loops, and randomization to create an engaging two-player game.


## 💫Features

- *Two-Player Mode* :  Play against a friend on the same device.
- *Interactive UI*  :  Clean and intuitive interface for placing 'X' or 'O' on the grid.
- *Win Detection*   :  Automatically detects and announces the winner or a draw.
- *Reset Game*      :  Option to reset the board and start a new game.
- *Game Timming*    :  Note rach round game timming .
- *3 Round Game*    :  Game has three rounds.
- *Score Tracking*  :  Keeps track of player scores across multiple rounds.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project helped me practice and understand:

- Functions → breaking code into reusable parts
- Loops → for repeated gameplay flow
- Conditionals → to check winning/draw logic
- Dictionaries → for maintaining scoreboard
